    <h3>Who is This Person?</h3>
    <P style="font-size: large;">He was a British-American sports car racing engineer and driver best known for his
        motorsport career in the US and with
        American teams on the international scene. He is an inductee to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.</P>

        <h3>Career :</h3>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">After the war, Miles raced Bugattis, Alfa Romeos, and Alvises with the Vintage
            Sports Car Club. He then turned to a Ford
            V8 Frazer-Nash.

            In 1952 Miles moved from England to the US, and settled in Los Angeles, California as a service manager for
            Gough
            Industries, the Southern California MG distributor.In 1953, he won 14 straight victories in SCCA racing in
            an
            MG-based special of his own design and construction.
            <br>
            For the 1955 season, he designed, constructed and campaigned a second special based on MG components that
            was known as
            the "Flying Shingle". It was very successful in the SCCA F modified class on the west coast. Miles raced the
            "Flying
            Shingle" at Palm Springs in late March, finishing first overall against veteran driver Cy Yedor, also in an
            MG Special,
            and novice driver, actor James Dean in a Porsche 356 Speedster. Miles was later disqualified on a technical
            infraction
            because his fenders were too wide, thus allowing Yedor and Dean to get 'bumped up' to first and second.
            During 1956,
            Miles raced John von Neumann's Porsche 550 Spyder at most of the Cal Club and SCCA events.

        <h3>Due to his great skill and talent, both as a driver and mechanical engineer, Miles was a significant member
            of the
            Shelby/Cobra race team in the early 1960s. Miles described himself this way:</h3>

        <p style="font-size: larger;">
            I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation
            for me, like
            golfing is to others. I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the grand prize, but just to see
            what it is
            like. I should think it would be jolly good fun!</p>

        <p style="font-size: larger;">He became the chief test driver of Shelby-American in 1963. <br>

            Miles had a "reputation for courtesy on the track" and was sometimes called the "Stirling Moss of the West
            Coast".
            While a member of the AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a Lotus 23 in the 1964 Player's 200 at Mosport. <br>

            In 1965, he shared a Ford GT Mk II with Bruce McLaren at the 24 Hours of Le Mans but retired with gearbox
            trouble.
            Earlier in the year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the 12 Hours of Sebring. <br><br>
            <center><img src="images/Ford_GT40_(rear).jpg" alt="car-rear-end"> </center>
            <br><br>
            The next year he won the 24 Hours of Daytona, sharing the Ford GT Mk II with Lloyd Ruby, and then won the 12
            Hours of
            Sebring. Several months later, sharing the drive with Denny Hulme, Miles was leading the 1966 24 Hours of Le
            Mans in the
            #1 car, but Ford Motor Company executive Leo Beebe, desiring a publicity photo of three of Ford's cars
            crossing the
            finish line together, instructed Miles to slow down, which he did. Accordingly, on the final lap the next
            car from Ford
            driven by Bruce McLaren/Chris Amon and the third-place car from Ford drew up, and they cruised to the line
            together.
            The French race officials, after initially agreeing to Ford's dead-heat "photo-finish", reneged during the
            final hour of
            the race. Although Miles' #1 car and McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line together, McLaren's #2 was
            declared the
            winner because having started in second position behind Miles' car, it had therefore covered 8 meters more
            distance
            during the race. Miles was denied the unique achievement of winning Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans in the
            same
            year.
        </p>
        <h3>Death :</h3>
        <center><img src="images/oldage.jpeg" alt="kenmiles"></center>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">The Ford J-car was intended to be the successor to the Ford GT40 Mk II and,
            despite reliability problems, showed
            potential in the springtime Le Mans trials. After the death of Walt Hansgen in a J-car while testing at Le
            Mans in
            April, Ford decided to shelve the J-car and focus on the proven Mk IIs. Little development was done for the
            rest of the
            1966 World Sports Car Championship season. In August 1966, Shelby American resumed testing and development
            work with
            Miles as primary test driver. The J-car featured a breadvan-shaped rear section experimenting with Kammback
            aerodynamic
            theories, and a honeycomb panel design supposed to both lighten and stiffen the car, but the design was
            unproven with
            high-speed prototype sports cars.
            <br><br>
            After almost a day of testing at Riverside International Raceway in the very hot Southern California desert,
            Miles
            approached the end of the track's one-mile (1.6 km) downhill back straight at top speed over 200 miles per
            hour (320
            km/h) when the car suddenly looped, flipped, crashed, and caught fire. The car broke into pieces and ejected
            Miles,
            killing him instantly.
